Based on OpenPilot 0.5.8 from comma.ai

- Do not disable when Accelerator is depressed (MAD button*)
- Disable auto-steering on blinker, but leave OP engaged
- - Disabled on first blink, and stays disabled until 1 second of no blinking.
- Sounds! (Thanks Sid and @BogGyver and #Tesla in general) (SND button*)
- Tesla UI (Thanks everyone in #Tesla)
- - 3 Switch positions change the display, you probably want it far left.*
- Advanced Lane Change Assist (Thanks @BogGyver) (ALCA button*)*
- - And with Blind Spot Detection for any Kia/Hyundai with it
- Panda auto-detects Camera Pinout
- - And now so does OP!  LKAS on CAN 2 or CAN 3, it doesn't matter!
- No need for giraffe switches, If no EON, then forwards stock camera (Thanks @JamesT-1)
- Dashcam Recorder (Thanks @pjlao307)
- Full Time Stock LKAS passthrough*
- - Including High Beam Assist and Automatic Emergency Braking, Blind Spot, Traffic Sign Detection, and more.
- - This includes Land Departure Warning, but stock LKAS must be enabled for this.
- Optional Dynamic Stock and OP Steering.  The moment OP isn't steering, it switched back to Stock (LKAS button*)*
- ** Temporarily removed ** CLI Based Real Time Tuning (Thanks @JamesT-1)
- Unsupported cars default to A special 'unsupported car'.  This should work for most cars.
- Cruise Setpoint set from OSM Speed Limit*
- Compress when not uploading
- Automatically detects CAN Specifics (checksum, SCC, so on)
- New Lateral Control from @Gernby
- Probably other things I have forgotten

* Has known issues

Known issues
------

- ALCA (Advanced Lane Change Assist) is not properly tuned.  Use with caution
- CAM (Stock LKAS Forwarding) occasionally silenetly faults, turning off stock LKAS
- Auto Speed Setpoint Control is irregular, the button spamming works perfect some times, not at all others
- Tri-State Switch is currently broken in NEOS, NEOS fix is needed
- Touch Events don't work properly in the new NEOS, changes are needed
- Panda Safety doesn't really exist
